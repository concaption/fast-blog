### FastAPI Blog ðŸ”¥

#### Introduction
Welcome to the FastAPI Blog ðŸ”¥ - a modern, fast (high-performance) blogging platform built with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. This application provides a robust backend system for blog management, offering features like user authentication, blog creation, updating, deletion, and real-time blog updates.

#### Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system to access token-based authentication.
- **Blog Management**: Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) functionalities for blog posts.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Leverage FastAPI's capability for real-time communication.
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation for user inputs to maintain data integrity.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to be easily scalable for future enhancements.

#### Endpoints
The application exposes several endpoints:

1. **Token**:
   - `POST /token`: User authentication to receive an access token.

2. **Users**:
   - `POST /users/`: Create a new user account.

3. **Blogs**:
   - `GET /blogs/`: Retrieve all blogs.
   - `POST /blogs/`: Create a new blog post.
